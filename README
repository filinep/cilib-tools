This program was created to assist me with my research.
It was hacked together over a period of time so it is a bit
rough around the edges.
Support for it will be provided on an "if-I-have-time" basis.
That being said it is open source so patches are welcome :)

Dependencies:
================================================================================
    Gtk (Tested with version 3.0 should (in theory :) work with 2.22 or maybe
         even earlier versions)
    Vte (Tested with 0.27)
    Python (Developed with v2.7.1)

================================================================================
Usage (i.e. limitations):
================================================================================
When first run there should be tabs along the top for algorithms, problems,
measurements and simulations. Clicking the add button adds a new section to the
selected tab. The simulator tab also has a run button which will run the
selected simulations. Progress is shown in the lower terminal window. When a new
section is added the combo boxes will show the classes allowed for that tag.
When an option is chosen from the list the methods pertaining to that choice are
added below it. Lots of assumptions were made with regards to what will be shown
but for the most part it should work. See the java file in the cilib folder for
these assumptions.

Initially the combo box shows "Default". This means that whatever CILib uses as
a default value will be used. It is assumed the user knows which tags have
default values. If the combo box shows "Primitive" it means that a value is
required, either a string or a number and not a class. This has to be entered
manually.

When opening existing xml files it is assumed that each simulation only uses
idrefs so no declaring of algorithms, etc., in the simulation tag. Also, for
now, idrefs cannot be used anywhere else e.g. in multi population algorithms.
No undo functionality is implemented so any changes that need to be undone will
have to be redone.

Copying and pasting can only be done within each tab. To copy select the root of
the section you want to copy, right click and select "copy". To paste select the
root of the section where you want to paste, right click and select "paste". The
section will be pasted as a child of the root.

My research involves PSOs so no testing has been done with other algortihms.
